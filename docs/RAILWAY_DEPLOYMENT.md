# Railway Deployment Guide

This guide covers the full end-to-end setup: Railway service configuration, secret management, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines across **dev**, **staging**, and **production** environments.

---

## Architecture Overview

TaskFlow deploys as two Railway services within the same project:

| Service | Dockerfile target | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `taskflow-server` | `packages/server/Dockerfile` → `production` | 4000 |
| `taskflow-client` | `packages/client/Dockerfile` → `production` | 80 |

The client is a static React app served by nginx, which proxies `/api` requests to the server via Railway's **private networking** (`taskflow.railway.internal:4000`). No traffic between client and server leaves the Railway network.

**CI/CD pipelines** (`.github/workflows/`) trigger Railway deploys automatically:

| Workflow | Trigger | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy-dev.yml` | Every merge to `main` | Railway `dev` environment |
| `deploy-staging.yml` | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) + optional SHA | Railway `staging` environment |
| `deploy-production.yml` | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) + reviewer approval | Railway `production` environment |

---

## Prerequisites

- A [Railway](https://railway.app) account
- Railway CLI installed: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- The GitHub repository linked to your Railway project
- Access to the dotenv-vault decryption keys for the target environments

---

## Step 1 — Create the Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new)
2. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo** and choose `taskflow`
3. Railway will detect the repo — do **not** let it auto-deploy yet; you will configure services manually

---

## Step 2 — Understand Secret Management (dotenv-vault)

The server uses [dotenv-vault](https://dotenv.org/env-vault) to manage secrets. All environment variables — including `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, and `NODE_ENV` — are stored **encrypted** in `.env.vault`, which is committed to the repo and baked into the production Docker image.

At runtime, the server decrypts the vault using a single key you provide:

| Variable | Value | Set on service |
|---|---|---|
| `DOTENV_KEY` | The decryption key for the target environment | `taskflow-server` |

To get the key for an environment, run locally:

```bash
npx dotenv-vault@latest keys staging
npx dotenv-vault@latest keys production
```

> MongoDB is hosted externally (e.g. MongoDB Atlas). Its connection string is stored encrypted inside `.env.vault` — no MongoDB add-on or separate Railway database is needed.

### Updating secrets

To rotate or update any secret (e.g. `MONGODB_URI` or `JWT_SECRET`):

1. Update the value in your local `.env.staging` or `.env.production` file
2. Run `npx dotenv-vault@latest push staging` (or `production`) to re-encrypt and update `.env.vault`
3. Commit and push `.env.vault` — the next Railway deploy will pick up the new values automatically via the same `DOTENV_KEY`

---

## Step 3 — Configure the Server Service

### Build settings (Settings → Build)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Build Command | *(leave blank — uses Dockerfile)* |
| Dockerfile Path | `packages/server/Dockerfile` |
| Docker Build Target | `production` |
| Root Directory | `/` (repo root) |

### Environment variables (Variables tab)

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `DOTENV_KEY` | Decryption key from `npx dotenv-vault@latest keys <env>` |
| `CLIENT_ORIGIN` | The public Railway URL of the client service, e.g. `https://taskflow-client-production-xxxx.up.railway.app` |

> `DOTENV_KEY` unlocks the vault and injects all other secrets automatically (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`). `CLIENT_ORIGIN` is set separately because it depends on the Railway-assigned client domain, which is not known at vault-build time.

### Networking (Settings → Networking)

- Click **Generate Domain** to give the server a public URL (used for `CLIENT_ORIGIN` above and for external API testing)
- Note the **Private Networking** hostname shown — it will be `taskflow.railway.internal` (or the short alias `taskflow`)

---

## Step 4 — Configure the Client Service

### Build settings (Settings → Build)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Dockerfile Path | `packages/client/Dockerfile` |
| Docker Build Target | `production` |
| Root Directory | `/` (repo root) |

### Environment variables (Variables tab)

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `BACKEND_URL` | `http://taskflow.railway.internal:4000` |

> **Important:** Use the private networking hostname (`taskflow.railway.internal`), not the public URL. This keeps traffic inside Railway's network and avoids latency and egress costs.
> The nginx startup script reads the container's DNS resolver automatically and substitutes `BACKEND_URL` at runtime — no rebuild is needed when this value changes.

### Networking (Settings → Networking)

- Click **Generate Domain** to give the client its public URL

---

## Step 5 — Deploy (first time)

Trigger a deploy on both services manually from the Railway dashboard. Railway will:

1. Build the Docker image from the repo root using the specified Dockerfile
2. For the **client**: nginx starts, reads `/etc/resolv.conf` for the DNS resolver, substitutes `$BACKEND_URL` into the nginx config, then serves the app
3. For the **server**: dotenv-vault decrypts `.env.vault` using `DOTENV_KEY`, injects all secrets, connects to MongoDB, and listens on port 4000

Verify by visiting the client's public URL and checking:
- The app loads (`/`)
- `GET <client-url>/api/flags` returns a JSON response (proxied through nginx to the server)

---

## Step 6 — Multiple Environments (Staging vs Production)

Railway supports **Environments** within a single project. Use this to maintain separate staging and production deployments.

1. In your project, click **Environments** → **New Environment** → name it `staging` and `production`
2. Each environment gets its own set of variable values and its own deployed instances of each service
3. Set a different `DOTENV_KEY` per environment — dotenv-vault will automatically load the matching vault entry (`DOTENV_VAULT_STAGING` or `DOTENV_VAULT_PRODUCTION`), which sets `NODE_ENV` and all other env-specific values

| Environment | `DOTENV_KEY` points to | Feature flags file | Flags enabled |
|---|---|---|---|
| dev | `DOTENV_VAULT_DEVELOPMENT` | `flags.dev.json` | 7 of 9 |
| staging | `DOTENV_VAULT_STAGING` | `flags.staging.json` | 4 of 9 |
| production | `DOTENV_VAULT_PRODUCTION` | `flags.production.json` | 2 of 9 |

---

## Step 7 — GitHub Actions Setup

Subsequent deploys after the first are handled automatically by GitHub Actions. The reusable workflow (`.github/workflows/_deploy.yml`) calls the Railway CLI to trigger a deploy — no local build steps run in CI; Railway builds the Docker image itself.

### Step 7a — Create a Railway Token

1. In the Railway dashboard → your project → **Settings** → **Tokens**
2. Click **New Token** and copy the value
3. You can use one token for all environments or create separate tokens per environment for tighter access control

### Step 7b — Create GitHub Environments

Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Environments** and create three environments:

| Environment | Protection rules |
|---|---|
| `dev` | None (auto-deploys on every merge to `main`) |
| `staging` | Optional: restrict to specific branches |
| `production` | **Required reviewers** — add at least one approver |

### Step 7c — Add Secrets per GitHub Environment

For each environment (`dev`, `staging`, `production`), add the following under **Secrets**:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | The Railway project token from Step 7a |

### Step 7d — Add Variables per GitHub Environment

For each environment, add the following under **Variables**:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_URL` | `https://taskflow-server-<env>-xxxx.up.railway.app` | Health check after deploy |
| `CLIENT_URL` | `https://taskflow-client-<env>-xxxx.up.railway.app` | PR comment and job summary link |

> Copy the exact public URLs from the Railway dashboard (the Railway-generated domains under each service's Networking settings).

### How the pipelines work

| Workflow | How to trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy-dev.yml` | Automatic — every push to `main` | Deploys both services to Railway `dev` |
| `deploy-staging.yml` | Manual — Actions tab → Run workflow (optionally provide a SHA) | Deploys to Railway `staging`, then comments on the associated PR |
| `deploy-production.yml` | Manual — Actions tab → Run workflow → waits for reviewer approval | Deploys to Railway `production`, then creates a GitHub Release |

## Troubleshooting

### 502 Bad Gateway on `/api` routes

nginx can't reach the server. Check in order:

1. **Wrong hostname** — Go to the server service → Settings → Networking and confirm the private hostname. Set `BACKEND_URL` on the client to `http://<private-hostname>:4000`
2. **Different Railway environments** — Private networking only works between services in the **same environment**. Ensure both client and server are deployed in the same Railway environment
3. **Server not running** — Check the server's Deploy Logs for startup errors (bad `DOTENV_KEY`, MongoDB connection failure, etc.)

### `host not found in upstream` on nginx startup

The `BACKEND_URL` variable is not set or is empty in the client service. Confirm the variable exists under the client's Variables tab and redeploy.

### `invalid port in resolver` on nginx startup

The container's DNS server is an IPv6 address and wasn't wrapped in brackets. This is handled automatically by the Dockerfile CMD — if you see this error it means the image was not rebuilt after the latest Dockerfile change. Force a redeploy.

### CORS errors in the browser

The `CLIENT_ORIGIN` variable on the server does not match the client's public URL. Update it to the exact origin (scheme + hostname, no trailing slash) and redeploy the server.

### MongoDB connection failures

The `DOTENV_KEY` is incorrect or points to the wrong environment, so `MONGODB_URI` is not being injected. Verify the key with `npx dotenv-vault@latest keys <env>` and confirm it matches what is set in Railway.

### GitHub Actions deploy fails with `unauthorized`

The `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret is missing, expired, or scoped to the wrong project. Regenerate it from Railway → Settings → Tokens and update the secret in the relevant GitHub Environment.
